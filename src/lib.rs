//! This crate provides a workload generator that emulates the traffic to
//! [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs). It is a mostly open-loop benchmark similar to
//! [TailBench](https://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez/papers/2016.tailbench.iiswc.pdf), but it also
//! approximates the partly open-loop designed outlined in [*Open Versus Closed: A Cautionary
//! Tale*](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi06/tech/full_papers/schroeder/schroeder.pdf) by
//! having clients potentially issue more than one query per request.
//!
//! The benchmarker has two main components: load generators and issuers. Load generators generate
//! requests according to actual lobste.rs traffic patterns as reported in
//! [here](https://lobste.rs/s/cqnzl5/), records the request time, and puts the request description
//! into a queue. Issuers take requests from the queue and issues that request to the backend. When
//! the backend responds, the issuer logs how long the request took to process, *and* how long the
//! request took from when it was generated until it was satisfied (this is called the *sojourn
//! time*).
//!
//! Trawler is written so that it can *either* be run against an instance of
//! the [lobsters Rails app](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters) *or*
//! directly against a backend by issuing queries. The former is done using the provided binary,
//! whereas the latter is done by linking against this crate as a library an implementing the
//! [`LobstersClient`] trait. The latter allows benchmarking a data storage backend without also
//! incurring the overhead of the Rails frontend. Note that if you want to benchmark against the
//! Rails application, you must apply the patches in `lobsters.diff` first.
